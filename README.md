# Cloud Security Automation Diagnostic Program
## 1. Development Environment
Programming Languages: PHP, JavaScript
Development Tools: Visual Studio Code, Vim
Server and Management: Apache, AWS EC2, Amazon Linux 2023, Amazon Linux 2, Ansible
Others: GitHub, Notion, Slack

## 2. Background
As part of the Hyundai AutoEver SW Mobility School project, we developed a cloud security automation diagnostic program utilizing Ansible. This project was designed based on KISA's Cloud Vulnerability Inspection Guide 2024, where we selected and developed diagnostic items accordingly. Our team decided to focus on diagnosing vulnerabilities in the LAMP stack, a technology that has been widely used in the past and continues to be prevalent in many companies.

Development Period: October 15, 2024 - October 25, 2024
